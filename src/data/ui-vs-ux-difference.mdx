# 🎨 UI vs UX: Why It _Really_ Matters

Great apps don’t just look good—they feel right. **User Interface (UI)** shapes _what_ people see. **User Experience (UX)** shapes _how_ they feel. Nail both, and you turn casual visitors into loyal fans.

---

## ✨ Key Differences

- **UI:** Color palettes, typography, spacing, iconography.
- **UX:** Research, personas, journey mapping, wireframes, usability testing.

<Tip title="Pro move">
  Start wireframes in grayscale. Once flows test well, layer on color and
  branding.
</Tip>

## 🛠 A Future-Proof Workflow

1. **Research ruthlessly:** Surveys, interviews, competitor audits.
2. **Prototype rapidly:** Low-fidelity first, iterate in hours—not days.
3. **Validate with users:** 5 users can uncover 80 % of issues.
4. **Polish the visuals:** Only after flows feel effortless.
5. **Measure & refine:** Continuous UX is your moat.

### 🚀 Next Steps

- Set up a **design system** in Figma to keep UI consistent.
- Introduce **accessibility audits** early—WCAG fixes are cheaper pre-launch.
- Pair every new feature with at least one **success metric** (task completion, NPS, etc.).
