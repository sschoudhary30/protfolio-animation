## 🛠 Setting Up a Scalable Design System

1. **Foundations first:** Colors, typography, spacing tokens.
2. **Build primitives:** Buttons, inputs, cards as components.
3. **Document usage:** Add Dos & Don’ts pages.
4. **Version & release:** Use Figma’s Team Libraries; tag versions (v1, v2).
5. **Sync with code:** Combine **Figma Tokens** + **Style Dictionary** for one-source-of-truth.

### 🔮 Next Steps

- Integrate **Figma Variables** (beta) to theme light/dark in seconds.
- Connect Figma to **Storybook** for side-by-side design-code parity.
- Track **component adoption metrics** to surface design debt early.
