# Getting Started with Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build modern websites quickly and efficiently by using utility classes directly in your markup.

### ðŸš€ Why Use Tailwind CSS?

- **Utility-first**: Write styles in your HTML using classes like `bg-blue-500`, `text-center`, `p-4`, etc.
- **Responsive design made easy**: Tailwind provides mobile-first breakpoints out of the box.
- **Customizable**: Tailwind is highly customizable via the `tailwind.config.js` file.
- **Fast prototyping**: You can build layouts without writing a single line of custom CSS.
