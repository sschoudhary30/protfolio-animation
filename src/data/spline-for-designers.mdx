# ðŸŒ€ Spline: 3D Without the Pain

3D used to mean steep learning curves and giant file exports. **Spline** flips that narrativeâ€”drag-and-drop modeling, physics, animations, and live WebGL embeds.

## ðŸŒŸ Why Spline Rocks

- **Browser-based editor:** No installs, work anywhere.
- **Real-time collaboration:** Like Figma, but for 3D scenes.
- **Code export:** Get a React component or glTF in seconds.
- **Physics & Interactions:** Hover, click, scroll triggers out of the box.

---

## ðŸ›  Workflow Overview

1. **Model primitives:** Shapes, text, imported OBJ/FBX.
2. **Add materials:** PBR, textures, HDRI lighting.
3. **Animate:** Timeline or state-triggered.
4. **Embed:** Copy React code or iframe snippet.
5. **Optimize:** Toggle _draco compression_ for lighter payloads.

### ðŸ”® Next Steps

- Use **Spline + Three.js** for custom shaders.
- Hook product data into Spline scenes for interactive e-commerce.
- Combine with **GSAP ScrollTrigger** for parallax 3D storytelling.
