# ‚ö° Prototyping with Framer

Framer evolved from a prototyping tool into a **full site builder** powered by React under the hood. Designers get motion magic; devs get clean code export.

---

## üé• Motion Made Easy

- **Smart Components:** Add micro-interactions with a visual timeline.
- **Variants & States:** Hover, pressed, drag‚Äîno code needed.
- **Code Overrides:** Sprinkle custom React for advanced logic.

## üåê Framer Sites: Design ‚Üí Deploy

1. **Design on canvas:** Layout like Figma, animate like After Effects.
2. **Add CMS data:** Collections for blogs, products, docs.
3. **Connect custom domain:** One-click via Vercel.
4. **SEO controls:** Meta tags, OG image, sitemap auto-generated.

<Tip title="Next-Level">
  Use **serverless functions** to fetch live data (tweets, GitHub stars)
  directly in Framer pages.
</Tip>

### üõ£Ô∏è Next Steps

- Migrate static marketing pages to Framer to free dev cycles.
- Pair with **Storyblok** or **Sanity** via the REST/GraphQL API.
- Leverage **A/B testing** using Framer‚Äôs sprint-based branching.
