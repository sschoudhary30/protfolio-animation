# 🚀 Introduction to Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework for building modern web applications. Developed by **Vercel**, it combines the best parts of React with built-in solutions for **server-side rendering (SSR)**, **static site generation (SSG)**, **API routes**, and more.

Whether you’re building a blog, an eCommerce platform, or a SaaS app—Next.js offers all the tools you need to scale efficiently and deliver fast experiences to users.

## 💡 What Makes Next.js Unique?

Next.js stands out from other React-based solutions due to its:

- 🔁 **Hybrid Rendering**: Use SSR, SSG, ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration), or even client-side rendering per page.
- 🚚 **File-based Routing**: No need for `react-router`; just create files in the `pages/` directory.
- ⚙️ **Built-in API Routes**: Create backend endpoints without spinning up a separate server.
- 🌐 **Optimized Performance**: Comes with automatic image optimization, code splitting, and more.
- 📦 **Zero Config**: Get started without any configuration, but it remains fully customizable.

<Tip title="Who Should Use Next.js?">
  If you’re already using React and want better SEO, faster load times, and
  built-in backend capabilities, Next.js is a great next step.
